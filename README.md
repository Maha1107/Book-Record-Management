# Book-Record-Management
Developing a Book Record Management system using Express.js involves creating a web application that allows users to manage a library of books efficiently. This project leverages Express.js for handling server-side operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Users can add new books, view a list of all books, update book details, and delete books from the record. The application will also implement routing, middleware, and database integration (e.g., MongoDB) to store and retrieve book data. This project aims to enhance skills in server-side JavaScript, RESTful API development, and database management. It provides practical experience in building scalable and maintainable web applications, focusing on back-end development and efficient data handling.
